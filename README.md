# Crackle Pop

## Overview
CracklePop is a simple program that prints out numbers from 1 to 100,  replacing certain numbers with strings based on divisibility rules. Specifically:

- If the number is divisible by 3, it prints `Crackle` instead of the number.
- If the number is divisible by 5, it prints `Pop` instead of the number.
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints `CracklePop`.

This program demonstrates basic programming concepts such as conditionals and loops, while also showcasing the use of simple algorithms to solve a problem.
